            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I’m  a biostatistics graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology.<br> I’ve always been passionate about solving real-world challenges, and my journey has led me to explore programming as a way to combine logic, creativity, and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>With experience in fields ranging from data analysis to mentorship,<br> I’ve developed a unique perspective on how technology can drive meaningful change. <br>Whether it’s contributing to impactful health policies or mentoring young minds, I thrive in opportunities where I can make a difference. <br>Programming excites me because it allows me to build solutions that not only work but inspire and empower.
            </p>
